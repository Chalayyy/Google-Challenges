"""
The problem: 
Given a square matrix, with values indicating the time to get from the row's starting point (the diagonals)
to the row with the same index as the value (the third value in a row takes you to the third row), find the greatest number of unique columns that 
can be visited, starting from the first row and column and ending with the last column, within a given time limit. 
Some values may be negative. Any spot may be revisited.

(You are rescuing bunnies which are at each column beyond the 0th and before the last.
A 5x5 matrix would have 3 bunnies: bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2. The last column represents
the exit.)

The solution:
Firstly, optimize the matrix. Find the shortest route to each spot from a row's starting point using the Bellman Ford algorithm (that is,
(if distance from row A to row B to row C is shorter than row A to row C, then row A to row C is modified to the smaller value). Repeat until no more changes are made.
From here, check each different permutation of paths that obeys the time limit and keep track of how many columns are visited in each one. 
If one path has more visited columns the the previous most, it becomes the ideal path unless another path overtakes it. 
Return all the columns between the 0th and last column that were visited.
