"""
This function compares the time to exectute two similar methods for 
determining the shortest number of steps to get from any natural 
number (positive whole number) to 1 by only dividing by 2, adding 1, 
or subtracting 1. solution1 is generally faster for terms with more than ~38 digits
Includes edits for 2.7
